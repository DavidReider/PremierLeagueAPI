# PremierLeagueAPI
A basic example of creating an API to collect Premier League News

Default API URL: https://premierleagueapi.herokuapp.com/

To get all articles picked up by the API: https://premierleagueapi.herokuapp.com/news

To get all articles from a specific news outlet append the news outlet as a new path after news.
Currently, the only two are:
- https://premierleagueapi.herokuapp.com/news/theguardian
- https://premierleagueapi.herokuapp.com/news/espn
